# Lift Control System

Algorithm in Java to control a lift. Depicts a "base case" (naive algorithm where the floor may
only change directions at the very and at the very bottom) as well as an improved algorithm
designed to minimise the time spent inside the elevator.

The user may configure the number of floors in the elevator system and run simulations using both
algorithms. "People" will be randomly generated for each simulation, and a log of the simulation is
printed in the console as well as statistics at the end of the simulation.
